# ML-LM
A tool that provides you with machine learning algorithms, data preparation techniques and 
last but not least comparing different models on a metric you decide.
The purpose of this project is double: from one site you can use the tools for your analysis, from the 
other you can learn how a particular technique works, being it all implemented from scratch, using just 
numpy, pandas and few other packages.

## Things implemented so far June 6th 2018:
- pca (numerical, categorical with pandas is coming soon);
- covariance shift tool.

## TODO:
- split the project in at least 3 subfolders: models (ml models), models comparison, data pre processing;
- finish pca
