# Principal Component Analysis

Tool that performs PCA on a dataset: if the dataset is numerical, the numpy version is employed
and classic eigenvectors/eigenvalues method is employed. If the data is both numerical and categorial,
the concept of "unlikability" [1] is exploited.

## TODO:
- provide documented implementation, test and a readme with an easy 'hello world'.
